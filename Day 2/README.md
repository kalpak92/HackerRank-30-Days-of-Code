# Day 2: Operators

## Objective 
In this challenge, you'll work with arithmetic operators. Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-operators/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

## Task 
Given the **_meal price_** (base cost of a meal), **_tip percent_** (the percentage of the **_meal price_** being added as tip), and **_tax percent_** (the percentage of the **_meal price_** being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's **_total cost_**.

**Note**: 
Be sure to use precise values for your calculations, or you may end up with an incorrectly rounded result!

### Input Format

There are  lines of numeric input: 
The first line has a double, **_meal price_** (the cost of the meal before tax and tip).

The second line has an integer, **_tip percent_** (the percentage of  being added as tip). 

The third line has an integer, **_tax percent_**  (the percentage of  being added as tax).

### Output Format

Print 
```Python
The total meal cost is totalCost dollars.
```
where **_total cost_** is the rounded integer result of the entire bill (**_meal price_** with added tax and tip).

### Sample Input

```Python
12.00
20
8
```

### Sample Output

```Python
The total meal cost is 15 dollars.
```
