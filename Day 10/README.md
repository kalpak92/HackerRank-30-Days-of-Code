# Day 10: Binary Numbers 


## Objective 
Today, we're working with binary numbers. Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-binary-numbers/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

### Task 
Given a base-10 integer, **n**, convert it to binary (base-2). Then find and print the base-10 integer denoting the **maximum number of consecutive 1's** in **n**s binary representation.

### Input Format

A single integer, **n**.

### Constraints
- **1 <= n <= 10<sup>6</sup>**

### Output Format

Print a single base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the binary representation of _n_.

### Sample Input 1
```Python
5 
```
### Sample Output 1
```Python
1 
```
### Sample Input 2
```Python
13
```
### Sample Output 2
```Python
2
```
### Explanation

_Sample Case 1_:  
The binary representation of **5** is **101**, so the maximum number of consecutive 1's is **1**.

_Sample Case 2_:  
The binary representation of **13** is **1101**, so the maximum number of consecutive 1's is **2**.
