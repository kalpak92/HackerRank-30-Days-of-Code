    Alternate Solution:
    
    print(k-1 if ((k-1) | k) <= n else k-2)
    '''
    '''
    Explanation for the above solution:
    When k is ODD , k-1 is EVEN , k-1 can always be reached by (k-1) & k.
    In binary form:
        k   = 11
        k-1 = 10
        k-1 == (k-1) & k
    That is , ((k-1) | k) is always k. And ((k-1) | k) <= n is always TRUE.
    
    When k is EVEN , k-1 is ODD , k-1 can only be reached if and only if ((k-1) | k) <= n is TRUE
    Why?
    In binary form:
        k   = 10110
        k-1 = 10101
        pos = 10111
        k-1 == (k-1) & pos
    You can get k-1 if pos <= n is TRUE. And you can get pos by ((k-1) | (k-1+1)) , that is , ((k-1) | k). Otherwise , you just need to follow the process above when k is ODD (because k-1 is ODD) , then you get the answer k-2.
    In brief , you can just do the test ((k-1) | k) <= n to determine the answer.
