# Day 9: Recursion

## Objective 
Today, we're learning and practicing an algorithmic concept called Recursion. Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-recursion/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

### Recursive Method for Calculating Factorial

### Task 
Write a factorial function that takes a positive integer, **N** as a parameter and prints the result of **N!** (**N** factorial).

**Note**: If you fail to use recursion or fail to name your recursive function factorial or Factorial, you will get a score of 0.

### Input Format

- **2 <= N <= 12**
- A single integer, **_N_** (the argument to pass to factorial).

### Output Format

Print a single integer denoting **N!**.

### Sample Input
```Python
3 
```
### Sample Output

```Python
6
```
